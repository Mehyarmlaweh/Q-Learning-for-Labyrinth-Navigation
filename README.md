## Introduction

Welcome to our Q-Learning project for solving labyrinth navigation problems! This repository explores the application of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to tackle maze puzzles using intelligent agents. In this README, we'll provide an overview of the project objectives, key features, usage instructions, references, and licensing information.

## Abstract

This report delves into the application of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to address labyrinth navigation challenges with intelligent agents. Starting with an introduction to Markov Decision Processes, it establishes the theoretical underpinnings necessary for comprehending sequential decision-making in uncertain environments. The Q-learning algorithm is introduced alongside its operation and essential parameters. Subsequently, a Python implementation of Q-learning for labyrinth-solving is detailed, encompassing maze environment specifics and algorithmic considerations. Additionally, the report explores experiments varying exploration-exploitation strategies and labyrinth sizes, offering insights into their impact on solution quality. The results underscore the effectiveness of Q-learning in labyrinth navigation, emphasizing its potential in tackling complex problems through reinforcement learning techniques.
